export const ABOUT_ITP = `
ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative uses of media and technology — how they might augment, improve and bring delight and art into people’s lives. Perhaps the best way to describe us is a Center for the Recently Possible.
<br><br>
The ITP Thesis is just one semester long and is taught as a class within the two-year period. It is the one class in which students work individually (i.e. not part of a team) and develop a project or their own choosing from concept to a proof-of-concept prototype.
<br><br>
The goal of an ITP education is that students leave here with the tools to do whatvever they want to do. Those tools include: knowing how to find out what they don’t know; to be ready for change, anticipate it; a willingness to experiment, fail, try again, etc; how to take an idea and make it real; to find their own strengths and deepen them; to follow your passions and trust their gut.
<br><br>
The faculty needs to see evidence both of mastery of these tools or qualities and of specific skills they have learned in their two years in the program.

Twenty-eighteen a year of variety––
<br>
Augmented meditation, existential anxiety...
<br><br>
Breathe with me now, as I proceed to enumerate
<br>
Projects that inspire,encourage,illuminate
<br><br>
problems in the world, politics, society’s confusions
<br>
But, there’s hope, because of your attempts at solutions:
<br><br>
Racism, Sexism, the news that you read
<br>
Objects that tell stories of waste and of greed.
<br><br>
Enter the blockchain, stand by the Green Line
<br>
How dull to be only one self at a time.
<br><br>
Prepare for the future, go back into history
<br>
To all mixed realities you’ve added artistry.
<br><br>
DIY, low-cost, OpenSource, ML, IoT
<br>
Dancing with AI Bots, Pollinate like a bee,
<br><br>
Hear the weather at home, connect with your grandma
<br>
Turn 2D to 3D, now that takes some chutzpah!
<br><br>
Subway musicians, a digital, but old time-y, camera
<br>
VR dreams that make real life seem a chimera.
<br><br>
Engage with sculptures that you cannot see
<br>
How to connect to a digital me
<br><br>
Platforms,tools,apps,performances, new biz
<br>
Machine listening, middle school learning, data viz
<br><br>
The range is so wide, serious and fun
<br>
I’m sorry I’ve no room to cite every one.
<br><br>
We celebrate your class, a glorious creative entity,
<br>
And also a collection of sparkling identities
