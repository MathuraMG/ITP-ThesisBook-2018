ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative uses of media and technology — how they might augment, improve and bring delight and art into people’s lives. Perhaps the best way to describe us is a Center for the Recently Possible.
<br><br>
The ITP Thesis is just one semester long and is taught as a class within the two-year period. It is the one class that students work individually (i.e. not part of a team) and develop a project or their own choosing from concept through a proof-of-concept prototype.
<br><br>
The goal of an ITP education is that students leave here with the tools to do whatvever they want to do. Those tools include: knowing how to find out what they don’t know; to be ready for change, anticipate it; a willingness to experiment, fail, try again, etc; how to take an idea and make it real; to find their own strengths and deepen them; to follow your passions and trust their gut.
<br><br>
The faculty needs to see evidence both of mastery of these tools or qualities and of specific skills they have learned in their two years in the program.
